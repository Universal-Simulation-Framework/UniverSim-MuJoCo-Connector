## Key Features
- Incorporates an advanced physics engine sourced from https://mujoco.org/
- Supports import and export of URDF and MJCF formats
- Enables exporting of simulation results in the USD format
- Integrates controller interfaces, controller managers, and hardware interfaces sourced from http://wiki.ros.org/ros_control
- Implements PD computed-torque control for enhanced stability
- Enables spawning and destruction of objects during run-time via rosservice
- Synchronizes simulation time with real time, with the ability to adjust simulation time for faster or slower execution
- Provides comprehensive visualization of MuJoCo elements within rviz
- Offers velocity control for the base
- Supports mimic joints from URDF format

## Troubleshooting
1) `ERROR: gladLoadGL error`
- Solution: `sudo apt install nvidia-driver-515`
